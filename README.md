# github-desktop-cicd

Let's break this down step-by-step, focusing on the CI/CD aspect of building a Docker image from a Dockerfile and then deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster using a manifest file, all while using GitHub and GitHub Desktop for version control.

Prerequisites:
- You have a GitHub repository with a Dockerfile and a Kubernetes deployment manifest.
- You're using GitHub Desktop to manage this repository.
- You have a Docker Hub account (or another container registry) to store your Docker images.
- You have a Kubernetes cluster set up (like AKS, EKS, GKE, or a local one like minikube).


Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Version Control with GitHub Desktop:
Clone Your Repository: If you haven't already, use GitHub Desktop to clone your repository to your local machine.
Make Changes: Modify your Dockerfile or application code as needed.
Commit and Push: Using GitHub Desktop, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you modify a file and commit the changes using GitHub Desktop:

1. Ensure You Have the Repository Cloned:
Before you can make changes, ensure you have the repository cloned to your local machine using GitHub Desktop.

2. Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended):
It's a good practice to create a new branch when you're making changes. This way, the main or master branch remains untouched until you're sure about your changes.

```
Open GitHub Desktop.
Select your repository from the left pane.
Click on the Current Branch dropdown at the top.
Click on New Branch and give it a descriptive name.
Click Create Branch.

I NAMED IT pod-to-dep

3. Modify the File:
In GitHub Desktop, with your repository selected, click on the Open in [Default Editor] button. This will open the repository in whatever your default code editor is (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom).
Alternatively, you can navigate to the repository folder using Finder (on macOS) or File Explorer (on Windows) and open the file you want to modify with your preferred text editor.
Make the necessary changes to the file.
Save the file and close your text editor.

4. Commit the Changes:
Return to GitHub Desktop. You should see the changes you made listed.
In the bottom left corner, enter a commit summary (and an optional description).
Click Commit to [pod-to-dep].

5. Push the Changes:
Click the Push origin button at the top to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

6. Create a Pull Request (If you created a new branch):
If you made your changes on a new branch and you want to merge them into the main or master branch, you can create a pull request:

On GitHub Desktop, click on Branch in the top menu and select Create Pull Request. This will open your browser to the GitHub page for your repository.
Follow the on-screen instructions to create a pull request.
Once your pull request is reviewed (if working with a team) and you're sure about the changes, you can merge it into the main branch.

Remember, the key is that GitHub Desktop is for managing Git operations, not for directly editing files. Always use an appropriate text editor or IDE for editing.
```

2. Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:
In your GitHub repository, navigate to the Actions tab.

Click on New workflow or set up a workflow yourself.
Define the CI/CD Workflow:
You'll be presented with a YAML editor. Here's a basic workflow to build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub:

```
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or your default branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest
```

Add Secrets to GitHub:
For the above workflow to access your Docker Hub, you need to add your Docker Hub credentials as secrets in GitHub.

```
Setting up Docker Hub Credentials in GitHub:
Login to Docker Hub:
Go to Docker Hub and sign in with your credentials.
Create a Personal Access Token (PAT):
Once logged in, click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select Account Settings.
From the left sidebar, select Security.
Under Access Tokens, click on New Access Token.
Give your token a descriptive name, like github_actions, and click Create.
Copy the generated token. Make sure to save it securely, as you won't be able to see it again.
Login to GitHub and Open Your Repository:
Navigate to the main page of your GitHub repository.
Add Secrets:
Click on Settings at the top of the repository.
From the left sidebar, select Secrets and variables, then click on Actions.
Click on the New repository secret button.
Create a secret named DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and set its value to your Docker ID (username).
Create another secret named DOCKERHUB_TOKEN and set its value to the Personal Access Token you generated on Docker Hub.
```


Commit the Workflow:
Save the YAML file, commit it, and push it using GitHub Desktop.

Automate Kubernetes Deployment:
After pushing the Docker image, you can add steps to deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster. This can be complex, as it requires setting up kubectl in the CI environment and securely handling kubeconfig or other credentials. For simplicity, here's a basic idea:

Copy code
    - name: Set up Kubeconfig
      run: echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}" > ./kubeconfig
      env:
        KUBECONFIG: /path/to/kubeconfig  # Adjust this path

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


You'd need to add your kubeconfig file (without sensitive info) as a secret in GitHub, similar to the Docker Hub credentials.

Monitor the Workflow:
After setting up the workflow, every time you push changes to your repository using GitHub Desktop, GitHub Actions will automatically build the Docker image, push it to Docker Hub, and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

You can monitor the progress of these actions in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.

Note:
This is a basic setup and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements, especially around Kubernetes deployment. Handling Kubernetes credentials securely is crucial. Consider using specialized tools or services for more complex workflows or if you need advanced features and security.
